      <h2>Understanding F1 Hybrid Power Units</h2>

      <h3>What is a Hybrid Power Unit?</h3>
      <p>
        Formula 1 cars use hybrid power units (HPUs), which combine a traditional internal combustion engine with advanced electric systems.  
        The main engine provides raw power, while the electric system stores extra energy that can be used strategically during a race.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Energy Recovery System Works</h3>
      <p>
        The ERS has two main parts: the Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K) and the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H).  
        The MGU-K converts braking energy into electricity, and the MGU-H captures heat from the turbocharger.  
        Energy is stored in a battery for short bursts of speed, useful for overtaking or defending.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Hybrid Power Units Are Important</h3>
      <p>
        HPUs are carefully designed for performance, efficiency, and reliability. Teams spend millions developing them, and even small gains can influence race outcomes.  
        Understanding HPUs allows fans to appreciate the engineering brilliance behind every lap.

      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hybrid power units combine a combustion engine and electric systems to maximize speed and efficiency.</li>
        <li>The ERS captures energy from braking and heat, storing it for strategic use.</li>
        <li>Proper use of ERS can give drivers a critical advantage.</li>
        <li>HPUs are a core reason modern F1 cars are advanced racing machines.</li>
