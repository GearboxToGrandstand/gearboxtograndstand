      <h2>Understanding F1 Hybrid Power Units</h2>

      <h3>What is a Hybrid Power Unit?</h3>
      <p>
        Formula 1 cars use hybrid power units (HPUs), a combination of a traditional internal combustion engine and advanced electric systems.  
        The main engine provides raw power, while electric systems capture and store extra energy for strategic bursts of speed.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Energy Recovery System Works</h3>
      <p>
        The ERS has two main parts: the Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K) and the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H).  
        These capture braking and heat energy, storing it in a battery for later use. Drivers use this extra energy to overtake or defend positions.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Hybrid Power Units Are Important</h3>
      <p>
        HPUs balance power, efficiency, and reliability. Teams spend millions refining these systems, as even small improvements can change race outcomes.  
        They‚Äôre one of the most fascinating aspects of modern F1.
